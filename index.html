<h2 class="headings">Interest in IT</h2>
<p2 class="paragraphs">My intrest in IT started from a workshop which I attended when in was in class eighth.
  The workshop name was THE MODERN DAY WORLD.  It was a worshop about computer science ,
  coding, gaming , different programming languages, machine learning etc.
  There one of my teacher explained me about the IT sector and I kind of got more
  curious to know about this more . Personally at that time I got more interested
  in gaming and software development. After that in my higher secondary I
  started to learn programming languages like python and c++ and now
  I have a basic knowledge of both the languages.My main interest is in software development. It has a great scope and also it is very interesting.
   Developing softwares on your own is such a new and innovative task. Really looking forward to this. <br><br>I chose
   RMIT because of the course structure and also it is one of the finest universities in Australia for Information Technology.
  It also has a great course structure as well as it offers many internship opportunities.
  I found the university perfect for me.<br><br>I expect during my course I will get a deep and good knowledge about the course and more about how
  to tackle real life tech problems and also will be able to perform various other skills when given an opportunity.</p2>
<h3 class="headings">IDEAL JOB</h3>
<img src="idealjob.jpg" style=width:680px;float:right>
<p3 class="paragraphs">My ideal job is of a Software Engineer which is a dream job for me since I
   attended that workshop in class eighth. It is a job which is a well-known
   job in the market. Also, it is a job which requires a great skillset and
   it is not an easy thing to do. Also, there is a job security in this position
   in a company. Becoming a good software developer is so fascinating.
   You can do many different things like this will make you a good
   leader like if you become a senior software developer in a company
   which will also enhance your leadership skills, communications skills and will
   also help you learn more and more.<br><br>You need various skills to become a software engineer.
   You should be able to make your own software. You need good problem solving and analytical skills. You
   also must be good at managing group projects and many other multi-tasks. Sometimes you will have people in your
   group who will have different ideas whom you wont agree that but you have to accept that. You
   also need to have a good experience at many programming languages like python, java script,
   C++, SQL, PHP etc. Many software developers do not have a good hold to all languages but if you want
   your work to be easier and smoother you should have experience in every language. It is not
   necessary to have a degree in software , if you have the skills and you can complete your
   projects and softwares smoothly you can easily get a job in this sector. Developing skills is more
   important rather than focusing on getting a degree.<br><br>I am a very patient person which is my best trait.
   I have great communication skills and I very enthusiastically participate in group projects which
   helps me learn more through it and gives me new ideas. Also, I have basic knowledge of coding languages like python, C++.
   In the last two years I have a great hold of python languageas as I started to learn
   it by myself and now have a decent idea of that language.<br><br>In the next few years,
    I will improve and enhance my skills which I lack and need. I will also participate in many different group projects
    so that my communication and multi-tasking skills get more fluent with time. Also, I will practice more and more so
  that my coding skills get better. Also doing many internships will make my resume look much more awesome.</p3>
