<h2 class="headings">Interest in IT</h2>
<p2 class="paragraphs">My intrest in IT started from a workshop which I attended when in was in class eighth.
  The workshop name was THE MODERN DAY WORLD.  It was a worshop about computer science ,
  coding, gaming , different programming languages, machine learning etc.
  There one of my teacher explained me about the IT sector and I kind of got more
  curious to know about this more . Personally at that time I got more interested
  in gaming and software development. After that in my higher secondary I
  started to learn programming languages like python and c++ and now
  I have a basic knowledge of both the languages.<br>I chose RMIT because of the course structure and also it is one of the finest universities in Australia for Information Technology.
  It also has a great course structure as well as it offers many internship opportunities.
  I found the university perfect for me.<br>I expect during my course I will get a deep and good knowledge about the course and more about how
  to tackle real life tech problems and also will be able to perform various other skills when given an opportunity.</p2>
